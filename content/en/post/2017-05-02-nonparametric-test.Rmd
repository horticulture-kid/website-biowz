R provides functions for carrying out Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon Signed Rank, Kruskal Wallis, and Friedman tests.

- independent 2-group Mann-Whitney U Test
```{r, eval = FALSE}
wilcox.test(y ~ A) # where y is numeric and A is A binary factor
```
- independent 2-group Mann-Whitney U Test
```{r, eval = FALSE}
wilcox.test(y, x) # where y and x are numeric
```
- dependent 2-group Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test
```{r, eval = FALSE}
wilcox.test(y1, y2, paired = TRUE) # where y1 and y2 are numeric
```
- Kruskal Wallis Test One Way Anova by Ranks
```{r, eval = FALSE}
kruskal.test(y ~ A) # where y1 is numeric and A is a factor
```
- Randomized Block Design - Friedman Test
```{r, eval = FALSE}
friedman.test(y ~ A | B) # where y are the data values, A is a grouping factor and B is a blocking factor
```
