This should make the difference clear. `seq()` acts like `seq_along()` except when passed a vector of length 1, in which case it acts like `seq_len()`.  If this ever once bites you, you'll never use seq() again!

``` {r, eval = TRUE}
a <- c(8, 9, 10)
b <- c(9, 10)
c <- 10

seq_along(a)
seq_along(b)
seq_along(c)

seq(a)
seq(b)
seq(c)
```

It's probably worth noting that `sample()` exhibits similarly crummy behavior:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
sample(a)
sample(b)
sample(c)
```
