## Professional skills

- Statistics. I teached two statistical courses to master students. I have moderate experience in using *R* for statistical modeling and data visualization. Besides the basic ones, I used the following R packages a lot: [*data.table*](http://r-datatable.com), [*dplyr*](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org), [*ggplot2*](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org), [*car*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/car/index.html), [*lme4*](https://github.com/lme4/lme4), [*gam*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gam/index.html) etc. I also created a R package myself, called [*acqr*](https://github.com/likanzhan/acqr).

- Experimental techniques. I'm familiar with [E-prime](https://www.pstnet.com/eprime.cfm), [Psychopy](http://www.psychopy.org), [Psychtoolbox](http://psychtoolbox.org), and [Presentation](https://www.neurobs.com/presentation) for presenting test stimuli. I have advanced experience in using Eyelink II/1000 plus (SR Research Ltd.), such as *Experiment Builder* for experiment building, and *Data Viewer* for data analysis. I am in charge of establishing the first Child MEG lab in China, familiar with *Yokogawa* MEG system for equipment maintenance and MEG data acquisition. I'm also familiar with *BESA*, and some Matlab packages for analyzing the E/MEG data, such as [*fieldtrip*](http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org) and [*SPM12*](https://github.com/neurodebian/spm12).

- Typesetting. I like to write with LaTeX, Markdown, and R Markdown. I created a [personal website](https://likan.info) with [*hugo*](https://gohugo.io) and [*blogdown*](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown).
