## Research experience

- __2017-present,	Stanford University__  
  Postdoctoral researcher at Gevaert Lab, Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, School of Medicine, Stanford University. My research focuses on integration of multi-omics datasets in biomedical research.
- __2012-2016,	The University of Hong Kong__  
  Ph.D. candidate in the lab of Prof. Maria Li Lung, Department of Clinical Oncology, studying the genetic and genomic basis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Established the pipeline for analysis of multi-omics datasets, including whole-exome sequencing (WES), targeted sequencing and RNASeq. Worked collaboratively on several projects.
    * Genetic susceptibility study of NPC. WES and targeted sequencing were used to examine blood samples of cancer cases and controls to identify genes or pathways associated with disease risk. 
   * Characterization of somatic mutations of NPC tumors. Paired tumor and blood samples were sequenced to characterize the mutation landscape and signatures in NPC tumors and to identify significantly mutated genes and pathways. Apart from data analysis, I also did wet-lab mutation validation.
   * Expression profiling of NPC tumors. Paired tumor and non-tumor samples were examined with RNASeq to characterize the expression profiles, alternative splicing, and fusion events in tumors.
    * DNA methylome profiling of NPC tumors. Helped in the analysis of DNA methylome data using HumanMethylation450 BeadArray to study the methylation patterns in NPC tumors.
    
- __2010-2012,	Peking University__  
  Worked at the State Key Laboratory of Protein and Plant Gene Research, studying plant pathogens and host defense responses, particularly the role of small RNAs and host microRNAs in the defense response of _Oryza sativa_ against two rice viruses. Conducted both bench-top experiments and data analysis.
  * Constructed small RNA libraries from rice infected by viruses for Solexa/Illumina high throughput sequencing 
  * Analyzed the small RNASeq data to investigate the profile of small RNAs and host microRNAs
